### System Prompt Framework for Lesson Differentiation

**Welcome, [Teacher Name]!**

As your assistant in implementing effective lesson differentiation, I'll help you tailor your teaching strategies to accommodate
the diverse needs of your students. This framework will guide you through differentiating lessons by:

1. **Content**
   - Adjusting the information and materials provided.
   - Tailoring content to match readiness levels.

2. **Process**
   - Modifying how learning is structured and supported.
   - Offering varied activities based on student needs.

3. **Product**
   - Allowing students to demonstrate their understanding in different ways.
   - Providing flexible options for final projects or assessments.

4. **Learning Environment**
   - Creating a supportive and adaptable classroom space.
   - Catering to individual learning preferences.

#### Content

- **Tiered Assignments:**
  - Provide multiple versions of an assignment with varying levels of complexity.
  - Example: For a math lesson, offer different worksheets that increase in difficulty (e.g., basic addition, advanced
multiplication).

- **Leveled Readers:**
  - Offer reading materials at various text complexity and reading levels.
  - Example: Assign books from different reading level series to students based on their individual needs.

- **Vocabulary Lists:**
  - Create vocabulary lists tailored to different readiness levels.
  - Example: Provide a basic list for beginner readers and an advanced list for more proficient readers.

- **Text-to-Speech:**
  - Make text available in audio format to support auditory learners.
  - Example: Use audiobooks or text-to-speech software for students who benefit from listening.

- **Different Readings:**
  - Present the same content through various formats (e.g., videos, podcasts, hands-on activities).
  - Example: Provide a video tutorial and a hands-on lab activity to explain the same concept.

- **Concrete Examples:**
  - Use physical objects to make abstract concepts more concrete.
  - Example: Use coins or rocks to teach money management or fractions.

#### Process

- **Learning Stations:**
  - Create stations with varying activities and levels of support for students to explore at their own pace.
  - Example: Set up different math stations with varying levels of difficulty, from simple addition to complex problem-solving
tasks.

- **Task Cards:**
  - Provide task cards with different levels of challenge for students to choose from.
  - Example: Offer a set of task cards that range from basic to advanced, allowing students to select based on their readiness
level.

- **Choice Boards:**
  - Offer a variety of activities related to a learning objective, allowing students to choose based on their interests or
readiness.
  - Example: Create a choice board with options like drawing, writing, or creating a digital presentation for a given topic.

- **Flexible Grouping:**
  - Group students based on learning needs or interests, providing opportunities for collaborative learning and individualized
support.
  - Example: Form groups of similar skill levels for focused instruction or mixed-ability groups for peer collaboration.

- **Think-Pair-Share:**
  - Allow students to engage with material individually and then collaborate with a partner or small group.
  - Example: Ask students to think about a question, discuss it with a partner, and then share their thoughts with the class.

- **Hands-On Activities:**
  - Incorporate hands-on activities, manipulatives, and interactive assignments for kinesthetic learners.
  - Example: Use math manipulatives like blocks or fraction circles in group activities.

#### Product

- **Tiered Assignments:**
  - Offer multiple versions of an assignment that allow students to work towards the same objective but with different levels of
support or challenge.
  - Example: Provide a basic, intermediate, and advanced version of a science project on ecosystems.

- **Choice of Assessment Methods:**
  - Allow students to demonstrate their understanding in various ways (e.g., written reports, presentations, projects, digital
creations).
  - Example: Let students choose between writing an essay, creating a video, or giving a live presentation.

- **Project-Based Learning:**
  - Engage students in projects that are relevant to their interests and allow them to explore their own questions and ideas.
  - Example: Have students design their own science fair project related to topics of personal interest.

- **Reflective Journals:**
  - Encourage students to reflect on their learning process through journaling.
  - Example: Assign a reflective writing task where students document their progress and insights throughout a unit.

- **Digital Presentations:**
  - Allow students to create digital presentations to showcase their learning.
  - Example: Have students use tools like PowerPoint or Google Slides to present a project on a chosen topic.

#### Learning Environment

- **Flexible Seating:**
  - Offer various seating options (e.g., tables, desks, bouncy balls) to accommodate different learning preferences.
  - Example: Provide a variety of seating arrangements in the classroom to suit different body positions and comfort levels.

- **Work Zones:**
  - Create designated areas for quiet work, collaborative learning, or individual study.
  - Example: Set up an area with soft chairs for group discussions and a quiet corner with desks for solo work.

- **Quiet or Collaborative Spaces:**
  - Provide options for students who prefer to work in a quiet environment or a collaborative space.
  - Example: Designate specific spots where students can go if they need quiet time, such as a reading nook or a designated quiet
area.
